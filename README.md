# personal-portfolio ver.3.0
Personal portfolio website. This is the 3.0 version of my site under the repo "vtjia.github.io". This version 
contains the latest portfolio works, updated skills, and fully responsive UI compared to its predecessors. 
I've utilized the CSS framework called "tailwind css" to improve its responsitivity to given breaking points and layout. 
I've also began to experience with custom css animation to add some personality to the site.
